# Fortnite_app
FortniteApp is mobile application for the Android operating system, which support Fortnite Battle Royale players by communicating with a publicly available external server.
The application provide users with information such as displaying match
statistics of any player, presenting current and upcoming changes in the game, displaying cosmetics available in the store,
as well as the ability to search for historical information on each product since the game's inception and presenting existing gameplay modes.

# Structure
The application implements a clean architecture methodology combined with the MVVM pattern. It is divided into four layers:
- App: Contains all activities, fragments, and view models.
- Domain: Contains all use cases used in the app.
- Data: Contains all endpoints, along with their data and responses.
- Core: Contains the architectural structure with generic support for fragments, activities, view models, and dependency injections.

# API Source
FortniteApp fetches data using the free package of the public service.
